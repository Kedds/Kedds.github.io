                <p>
                   In Summer of 2024 I began work on a research project exploring the molecular dynamics of RNA and DNA dimers on the surface of an ice crystal. The goal of this project is to identify differences in mobility between different combinations of nucleobases and between the RNA and DNA counterparts of these combinations.

                <p>3D glasses required! This is a visualization of a GG DNA dimer -- a two-letter long strand of DNA where both units contain the nucleobase Guanine.  </p>

                   Currently, I am focusing on setting up and analyzing simulations using GROMACS, an open-source molecular dynamics suite. In each simulation, a dimer is dropped onto the surface of the ice and allowed to move freely for about 500 nanoseconds. We repeat this several times at slightly different temperatures, usually ranging from 224 to 236 kelvin. We perform our analysis by tracking the distance the dimer moves over time, as well as which locations certain parts of the molecule prefer to sit.

                <p>This is an image from a simulation of a GG RNA dimer. The molecule has penetrated the upper "quasi-liquid" layer of the ice crystal and is bound to the more rigid crystalline lattice underneath.</p>
