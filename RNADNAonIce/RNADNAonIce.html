                <p>
                   In Summer of 2024 I began work on a research project exploring the molecular dynamics of RNA and DNA dimers on the surface of an ice crystal. The goal of this project is to identify differences in mobility between different combinations of nucleobases and between the RNA and DNA counterparts of these combinations.
