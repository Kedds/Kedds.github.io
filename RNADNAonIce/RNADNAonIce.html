                <h1>RNA/DNA on Ice</h1>

                <p>
                   In Summer of 2024 I began work on a research project exploring the molecular dynamics of RNA and DNA dimers on the surface of an ice crystal. The goal of this project is to identify differences in mobility between different combinations of nucleobases and between the RNA and DNA counterparts of these combinations.

                <h2>The RNA World Hypothesis</h2>
                <p>
                   RNA World is a proposed model of the evolution of life on Earth, starting from organic compounds deposited on the planet's surface during its formation. While many of the finer details are debated, the general hypothesis states that the first form of self-replicating life on earth took the form of RNA strands and ribozymes, enzymes made from RNA which can facilitate reactions and even self-replicate. DNA is said to have emerged later, but RNA remains in the present as a crucial part of the central dogma of molecular biology.
                </p>
                <p>
                   The RNA world precedes cellular life, so the molecules would have been exposed directly to the outside world. RNA under ambient conditions is not stable under the timescales needed for meaningful interactions to happen, and it tends to hydrolyze (split apart) at room temperature. For this reason, many versions of the RNA hypothesis propose that an RNA would would have mainly stayed on the surface of ice crystals, where temperatures are low enough that RNA can remain intact, but still remain mobile in the outer "quasi-liquid" layer of supercooled water surrounding the crystal.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Our research is relevant to this hypothesis as it may help to provide a clearer picture of why RNA could have been favored over DNA in the evolution of early life. We suspect that intramolecular bonding forces in RNA that are not present in DNA may be responsible for RNA having a higher mobility on ice. Being more mobile would allow RNA molecules to interact more often, leading to quicker adaptation and evolution.

                <h2>Methods</h2>
                <p>
                   Currently, I am focusing on setting up and analyzing simulations using GROMACS, an open-source molecular dynamics suite. In each simulation, a dimer is dropped onto the surface of an ice crystal and allowed to move freely for about 500 nanoseconds. We repeat this several times at slightly different temperatures, usually ranging from 224 to 236 kelvin. We perform our analysis by tracking the distance the dimer moves over time, as well as which locations certain parts of the molecule prefer to sit.
