                <img src="../cited_renders/4HK5 cordyceps.png" width="100%"></img>
                <p>This is a render of a Uracil-5-carboxylate decarboxylase enzyme made from data obtained from the RCSB. In this render I used a combination of both ribbon and ball-and-stick visualizations. The general shape of the enzyme can be seen more clearly in the ribbons, with each separate carbon chain highlighted in a different color. The ball-and-stick model displays parts which would otherwise not be visible, such as amine and thiol groups (blue and yellow respectively).  </p>

                <img src="../cited_renders/4V7Q rotavirus capsid.png" width="100%"></img>
                <p>This is a close-up render of a rotavirus capsid. This capsid is a hollow shell, constructed out of many identical subunits which tile together. The RCSB database entry I pulled this data from only included one copy of the subunit along with an assembly script, which I used to assemble the full capsid in post. This image was rendered using another backbone technique, which represents beta sheets using arrows and alpha helices using coils. As in the last image, each separate carbon chain is given a different color. <br><br> This image also shows off some of the different stylistic options granted by the software. Depth of field can be used to help give a better sense of depth in a static picture, and specular sheen can make warped surfaces stand out, such as the pleating on the beta sheet arrows.    </p>

                <img src="../cited_renders/5FIL bovine atp synthase.png" width="30%"></img>
                <p>This is a rendering of an ATP synthase complex using data from the RCSB. This protein is displayed using a space-filling sphere representation, with carbons colored by chain, nitrogens in blue and oxygens in red. <br><br> The software I used to render this protein draws images using a technique called raytracing. For every pixel in the image, a ray is cast from a virtual camera and bounced off of surfaces until finding a light. This process allows for complex and optically accurate lighting systems to be modelled, but is a very resource-intensive method of rendering. Often, hundreds of samples of each pixel have to be taken and averaged out to avoid excessive noise in the final image. Each molecule is represented in the software by a sphere distance function. This drastically simplifies the math which has to be performed each time a ray collides with a surface.  </p>
